**以下代码实现了压强和温度的转换** 

::

   function t=P2T(P)
   % 本函数实现了压强（MPa）向温度（℃）的转换
   % P为压强（MPa），T为温度（℃）

   [fitresult, ~] = fit( xData, yData, ft, opts );

3.2 汽爆强度计算代码
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**以下代码实现了汽爆强度的计算** 
 
:::

   function [R] = SES(T,t)
   %计算气爆强度
   %t代表维压时间/min,T代表温度/℃，R代表气爆强度
   %杨帆/2020/8/6
   R = t.*exp((T-100)./14.75)
   end


两者联立，就可以计算出不同温度（压强）和持压时间的汽爆强度。
